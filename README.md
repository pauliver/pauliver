_“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”_

― Robert A. Heinlein

I'm currently testing out this GitHub Personal Readme functionality. We'll have to see what the best use of it is in the long run, today I'm going to link to a few projects:
- https://github.com/pauliver/Awesome-Games - a list of gameing related stuff on GitHub
- https://github.com/Unreal-UX/KeepUnrealForkUpdated an Action to keep your Unreal Engine fork up to date
- https://github.com/photography (and https://gallerytest.pauliver.com/ ) are a way to host your photos on github.  (_let me know if it's broken, i try and keep it working_)
