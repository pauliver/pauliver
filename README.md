I'm currently testing out this GitHub Personal Readme functionality. We'll have to see what the best use of it is in the long run, today I'm going to link to a few projects:
- https://github.tips/ is not under active work, but is a great place to store tips about GitHub
- https://github.com/GSD/BookClub 
- https://github.com/photography (and https://gallerytest.pauliver.com/ ) gets work when it's broken enough, or after I travel somewhere and need to upload photos
