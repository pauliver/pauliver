When everyoen is remote it can be hard to tell how folks are doing. There is no opportunity to walk by someone and see that they need a chat, help, or just someone to listen to them. This shifts some of the burden (and the required EQ) to the people that may need help. In order to provide saftey nets for eachother, we should all check in (bi-directionally) with our leads. 

🏖= amazing, 95% to 110%
☀️= great, 85 to 95%  
⛅= 75 to 85
☁️ = 65 to 75
🌧= 50% to 65%
⛈= below 50%
🏝= alone on a desert island all by myself (without video games or booze or books to read)
